-- Some description about a project ... again:

Another learning project of mine. This one helps me learn lots of things. Such as: how the follow and unfollow function actually works in real life, and make chat function realtime with socketio. My teacher said that recently programmers have started using firebase to do this function instead of using socketio as before.

So yeah, I do have another project of using firebase with its built in functions to make the basic chat app. And actually firebase is working well with realtime activies with its "on snapshot". 

Back to this project, the main functions I make for this boy here are: creating, updating, not deleting because it's kinda easy so I skip that. And if you want to follow someone, go to his/her profile and click on follow button, then you will see that person's posts on your feed. And if you do want to unfollow, just click on unfollow button again. And you will see all of his/her followings as well.

And you can only do these above functions (crud) with your own posts like my blog project. And ofcourse, you can also like your post and your followers posts once.

In the future, I will make this project more useful for my own sake.

Thank you for reading!
